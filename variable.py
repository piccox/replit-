#### Band names generators
#1. create a greeting for your program. 
print("Welcome to the band name generator!")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in. 
city = input("Which city did you grow up in ? \n")

#3. Aske the user for the name of a pet. 
pet = input("What is the name of a pet\n")

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet show them their band name. 
city_pet = print("Your band name could be" + city + "" + pet)

#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at: http://band-name-generator-end.apprbrewery.repl.run/
